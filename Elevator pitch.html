                        <h1>My Personal Elevator Pitch</h1>
                        <p>
                            I am DUSHIME Simbi Benie, a prospective artist and digital art developer.
                            I am a hardworking student who recently graduated high school in history, 
                            economics, and geography. I was ranked first in my class consistently.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During my high school journey, I maintained academic excellence and served 
                            in various leadership roles. I was the chairperson of the school debate club, 
                            secretary of the writing club, and secretary of the student council. In addition, 
                            I was a member of the business club.
                        </p>
                        <!--<p>
                            I attended and won various debate tournaments hosted by iDebate Rwanda, an NGO 
                            aiming at improving the critical thinking and communication skills of high school 
                            students. I also participated in writing contests such as the Queen’s Commonwealth 
                            Essay Competition, and I never hesitated to grow and share my artistic skills.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Upon high school completion, I signed up to work with iDebate Rwanda as a volunteer 
                            to help build critical thinking among students. I also temporarily worked as a cashier 
                            in Afya Dairy, where I filled financial statements, managed inventory, and corrected 
                            errors in financial statements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition, I dedicated my gap year to art and programming, eager to learn how to create 
                            apps and software. I majorly learned HTML, CSS, C++, and JavaScript.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So far, I am working on SA Studio (Simbi Artz Studio), a digital art tool that consists 
                            of drawing and painting tools, comic creation tools, as well as other art tools that are 
                            easy to navigate and bring out fun in art.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition, I worked hand in hand with Titan Minds in the phase 2 of ALx pathway program, 
                            to create AgriRwanda, a digital platform that connects Rwandan farmers and enlightens 
                            them with essential skills, weather patterns, etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As I reflect on my journey, I have acquired several skills, such as public speaking, programming 
                            fundamentals, writing skills, Microsoft Office skills, etc., and I am determined to use my skills 
                            to be an impactful artist and digital art developer.
